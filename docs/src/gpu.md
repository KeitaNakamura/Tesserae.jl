# GPU computing

GPU support in Tesserae is built around the same transfer notation used on CPU.
Once the mesh, grid, particles, and basis weights are moved to a GPU backend, macros such as [`@P2G`](@ref) and [`@G2P`](@ref) launch GPU kernels instead of CPU loops.
This keeps the MPM update close to the CPU version while moving the particle-grid work to the GPU.

The code still needs to follow GPU array rules.
Grid and particle updates should be written as transfer macros, broadcasts, or GPU kernels, and data should be copied back to CPU memory only for inspection or output.

Load the GPU backend package together with Tesserae:

```julia
using Tesserae
using CUDA # or Metal
```

## Basic workflow

Choose the floating-point type first, then build the mesh, grid, particles, and weights from that type.
This keeps the code close to the CPU version while avoiding mixed precision inside GPU kernels.

```julia
using Tesserae
using CUDA

const T = Float32

GridProp = @NamedTuple begin
    x  :: Vec{2,T}
    m  :: T
    m⁻¹:: T
    mv :: Vec{2,T}
    v  :: Vec{2,T}
end

ParticleProp = @NamedTuple begin
    x :: Vec{2,T}
    m :: T
    v :: Vec{2,T}
end

mesh = CartesianMesh(T, T(0.02), (-1, 1), (0, 3))
grid = generate_grid(GridProp, mesh)
particles = generate_particles(ParticleProp, grid.x)
@. particles.m = 1
@. particles.v = zero(particles.v)
weights = generate_basis_weights(T, BSpline(Quadratic()), grid.x, length(particles))

grid_gpu = gpu(grid);
particles_gpu = gpu(particles);
weights_gpu = gpu(weights);
```

After that, the transfer code is the same as the CPU version.
A single update step can be written as:

```julia
function step!(grid_gpu, particles_gpu, weights_gpu, dt)
    update!(weights_gpu, particles_gpu, grid_gpu.x)

    @P2G grid_gpu=>i particles_gpu=>p weights_gpu=>ip begin
        m[i]  = @∑ w[ip] * m[p]
        mv[i] = @∑ w[ip] * m[p] * v[p]
        m⁻¹[i] = ifelse(iszero(m[i]), zero(m[i]), inv(m[i]))
        v[i] = mv[i] * m⁻¹[i]
    end

    @G2P grid_gpu=>i particles_gpu=>p weights_gpu=>ip begin
        v[p] = @∑ v[i] * w[ip]
        x[p] += v[p] * dt
    end
end

step!(grid_gpu, particles_gpu, weights_gpu, T(1.0e-4))
```

Use `cpu` to copy GPU data back to CPU memory, for example for output:

```julia
x = cpu(particles_gpu.x)
```

## GPU arrays

After calling `gpu`, grid fields, particle fields, basis weights, and mesh coordinates in the returned objects are GPU arrays.
Scalar indexing from CPU code falls back to the CPU and is disallowed in non-interactive CUDA.jl execution; see CUDA.jl's [scalar indexing workflow](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/usage/workflow/#UsageWorkflowScalar) for details:

```julia
julia> x = gpu(rand(3))
3-element CuArray{Float32, 1, CUDA.DeviceMemory}:
 0.7683449
 0.4430822
 0.88063353

julia> x[1]
ERROR: Scalar indexing is disallowed.
```

The same rule applies to fields such as `grid_gpu.v`, `particles_gpu.x`, and `weights_gpu`.

!!! note
    In the REPL, displaying an object that contains GPU arrays, such as `particles_gpu` or `grid_gpu`, can hit the same scalar indexing error.
    Suppress display with `;` when assigning GPU objects:

    ```julia
    particles_gpu = gpu(particles);
    ```

    Copy data back with `cpu` before inspecting values on the CPU.

Use array operations such as broadcasting or `map!`, or write the operation inside a transfer macro or a GPU kernel.
Indexing inside `@P2G` and `@G2P` is fine because the generated code runs in GPU kernels.
This is also how boundary conditions should be applied on GPU.
For example, on a 3D grid, a CPU slip floor boundary condition can be written as

```julia
for i in eachindex(grid)[:, :, begin]
    grid.v[i] = grid.v[i] .* (true, true, false)
end
```

On GPU, write the same operation as a broadcast:

```julia
slip_floor(v) = v .* (true, true, false)

@. grid_gpu.v[:, :, begin] = slip_floor(grid_gpu.v[:, :, begin])
```

## Floating-point type

`gpu` returns GPU arrays and, by default, converts floating-point arrays to `Float32`.
Use `gpu_preserve` instead when the original floating-point type should be preserved on the GPU.
The conversion applies to arrays and adapted Tesserae objects.
It does not rewrite scalar constants captured by a kernel, so write scalar constants with the intended type:

```julia
T = Float32

dt = T(1.0e-4)
gravity = Vec(T(0), T(-9.81))
```

This matters on Metal, where `Float64` cannot be used in GPU kernels.

## Transfers

GPU `@P2G` uses particle-parallel kernels with atomic updates.
Do not pass a [`ThreadPartition`](@ref) to GPU transfers; `ThreadPartition` is a CPU scheduling tool for threaded scattering.

CPU threaded scattering:

```julia
partition = ThreadPartition(grid.x)
update!(partition, particles.x)

@threaded @P2G grid=>i particles=>p weights=>ip partition begin
    m[i] = @∑ w[ip] * m[p]
end
```

GPU scattering:

```julia
@P2G grid_gpu=>i particles_gpu=>p weights_gpu=>ip begin
    m[i] = @∑ w[ip] * m[p]
end
```

`@G2P` is also dispatched to GPU kernels when the grid, particles, and weights are GPU objects.

## SpArray on GPU

[`SpArray`](@ref) can also be used on GPU.
Create the sparse grid on CPU, move it to the GPU, and update its sparsity directly from particle positions.
The same scalar-indexing rule applies: use `SpArray` through `update_sparsity!`, transfer macros, broadcasts, or GPU kernels rather than CPU loops over individual entries.

```julia
grid = generate_grid(SpArray, GridProp, mesh)
weights = generate_basis_weights(T, BSpline(Quadratic()), grid.x, length(particles))

grid_gpu = gpu(grid);
particles_gpu = gpu(particles);
weights_gpu = gpu(weights);

update_sparsity!(grid_gpu, particles_gpu.x)
update!(weights_gpu, particles_gpu, grid_gpu.x)

@P2G grid_gpu=>i particles_gpu=>p weights_gpu=>ip begin
    m[i] = @∑ w[ip] * m[p]
end
```

Call `update_sparsity!(grid_gpu, particles_gpu.x)` again after particle positions have moved and before the next transfer.
This keeps the active blocks large enough for the particle support nodes.

On GPU, `SpArray` mainly reduces grid-field storage and grid-wide operations over inactive regions.
It should not be expected to remove the main cost of `@P2G`, which is still proportional to the number of particles times the number of support nodes.

## Taylor impact on GPU

This section rewrites the [Taylor impact tutorial](@ref taylor_impact_tutorial) as a GPU simulation.
The transfer equations and the von Mises material model are unchanged; only the execution pattern is adjusted.
The main changes are:

- Remove CPU threading utilities such as `@threaded`, `ThreadPartition`, and `reorder_particles!`.
- Move the simulation objects to GPU with `gpu_preserve` after CPU-side setup.
- Keep grid and particle calculations inside GPU operations, using `@P2G`, `@G2P`, and broadcasts.
- Rewrite the slip floor boundary condition as a broadcast to avoid scalar indexing on GPU arrays.
- Copy data back with `cpu` only when writing VTK output.

For reference, the compute-only runtime on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, excluding VTK output, is:

| Precision | # Particles | # Iterations | Execution time (w/o output) |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Float64   | 1.48M       | 1.8k         | 1 min 01 sec                 |
| Float32   | 1.48M       | 1.8k         | 37 sec                       |

The VTK output is written to `output/taylor_impact_gpu`.
